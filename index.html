(git init)
Working Directory -->   (git add .) --> Staging Area  --> (git commit -m 'msg') --> local Repository

After commiting in local repository we need to move it to remote(github/gitlab)repository.Below are the steps

1.git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git
2.git push -u origin master  /*here origin is alias for SSH so that we don't have to write agai and again*/

Voila !! You are done <add commit and push from next time only, no need of remote add>

#some basic commands
git status
git log --oneline  //give commit id

#Git Branch Commands
git branch   //tells the branch you are in
git branch localbranchname  //create new branch
git add .  //add changes in branch
git commit -m 'Task done by branch'
git push -u origin localbranchname    //push to remote repo

#Git Merge commands
move to master to merge
git checkout master
git merge localbranchname
git push -u origin master
