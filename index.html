(git init)
Working Directory -->   (git add .) --> Staging Area  --> (git commit -m 'msg') --> local Repository

After commiting in local repository we need to move it to remote(github/gitlab)repository.Below are the steps

1.git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git
2.git push -u origin master  /*here origin is alias for SSH so that we don't have to write agai and again*/

Voila !! You are done <add commit and push from next only no need of remote add>

#some basic commands
git status
git log --oneline  //give commit id
